To compile the programs: 
    Use the make file, by simply typing 'make' into the command line. The make 
    file will simply remove any existing ".class" files in each directory, and
    then compile each of the programs, creating the new ".class" file that is
    runnable.

To run a program:
    After the program has been compiled, and you are in the directory 
    corresponding to the program you want to run, then use the command 
    'java [filename]' to run the program.

        example: type 'java DHeap' and press return.
