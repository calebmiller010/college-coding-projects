Caleb Miller
Freshman
Computer Science

I took a semester long class of HTML, and a semester long class of
Visual Basic in high school. I understand the basics of programming, 
how it works, etc. but I have no experience with Java yet.

I am taking this course because I am majoring in computer science
and want to learn basic java before any of my other programming classes
